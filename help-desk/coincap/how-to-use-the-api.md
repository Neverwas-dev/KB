# ðŸ–± How To Use The API?

Please see our API section [**here**](https://github.com/CoinCapDev/CoinCap.io). We also have documentation [**here**](https://docs.coincap.io/). There are two documents listed on our API Github page. Reading through the articles there should answer the majority of your questions. Use our API to build pricing data into your website on your own. If you have any specific questions, please open a ticket in our mobile app or email us directly at [**support@coincap.io**](mailto:support@coincap.io).
