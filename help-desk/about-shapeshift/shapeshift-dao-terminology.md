# ðŸ’Š ShapeShift DAO Terminology

**DAO -** Decentralized Autonomous Organization. Learn about our DAO's specific structure [**here**](https://forum.shapeshift.com/t/shapeshift-organizational-structure/50).

&#x20;

**FOX** - This is ShapeShift's governance token. It is an ERC20 token. ERC20 tokens are a second layer protocol on the Ethereum blockchain. All ERC20 tokens require ETH to send them across the Ethereum blockchain.

&#x20;

**FOX Liquidity Providing** - This is when you provide equal amounts of FOX and ETH to the UniSwap v2 FOX-ETH Liquidity pool.  This gives that liquidity pool depth and lowers the [**price impact**](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360061625672) of swaps. &#x20;

&#x20;

**FOX-ETH LP Tokens** - When you provide liquidity, UniSwap sends you back a FOX-ETH LP tokens.  Think of these as a coat check ticket that you give back to UniSwap when you want to remove your liquidity.

&#x20;

**FOX Staking** - This is when you send your FOX-ETH LP Tokens to the FOX Staking Contract so you can earn additional FOX Token rewards.

&#x20;
