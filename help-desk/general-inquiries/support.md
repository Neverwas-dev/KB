## What Happens After I Submit a Support Ticket? How Can I Track the Status?

After you submit a ticket with your ShapeShift deposit address, Order ID, and/or the transaction ID, you do not need to reach out to us again. We will contact you with your return information as soon as possible.\
\
If you create an account with Zendesk, you can **t**rack the status of tickets you've submitted via **"My Activities"** after logging in. We do our best to resolve all support requests within 24 hours.



## Does ShapeShift Have a Phone Number I Can Call?

It can be frustrating when you have questions about an exchange. While we know you want your issue resolved quickly, we do not have a phone support line for users.

If you need to contact us regarding an issue, please [**submit a ticket**](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). We will resolve your issue as quickly as we can.
