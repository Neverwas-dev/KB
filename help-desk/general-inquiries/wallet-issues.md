## I Can't View My Coins/Tokens In My Wallet

This is meant to be a guide for all crypto wallets. If you are having issues with a specific ShapeShift balance, please reach out to our team [**here**](https://shapeshift.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket\_form\_id=360000158419).

Please make sure that your wallet is **fully synced to the latest block and up-to-date**. You may see a refresh icon on your wallet.

Additionally, try updating the software of the wallet application.

If you can see your funds on the blockchain (try googling the coin name and "block explorer"), they are in the wallet and your wallet provider may just be experiencing some technical difficulties.

Sometimes, wallet-specific issues can occur as well. If the issue persists, you may reach out to your wallet provider.
